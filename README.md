*Brooklyn Nine-Nine* is my favorite series because it has a plot filled with various story-telling. I started watching this series on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/ph/title/70281562) around 4 years ago. It revolves mainly around the police precinct led by Captain Holt Raymond and the main detectives Jake Peralta, Rosa Diaz, Terry Jeffords, Charles Boyle, Amy Santiago, and many more :policeman:. The story starts comedic and easygoing in the early seasons, but it gets very heartwarming as it eventually reaches its finale episode.

*Avengers: Endgame* is personally the best movie I have ever watched since I've been a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've been watching the story from the first movies, and it reached peak fiction as this movie was released. The best part about the movie is it was released on cinemas on the day of my birth, April 26 :partying_face:. **Avengers: Endgame** is the culimnation of the years of storytelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as part of the Inifinity Stones saga. The movie starts off after the events of Avengers Infinity War, where the heroes have lost the battle against Thanos and half the population of the universe has been wiped out. Luckily, Scott Lang (Ant-Man) was able to provide a solution via time travel to bring back the people that were deleted from the universe. Here are my favorite scenes in the movie:
1. Thor embracing the truth and reality when he goes back in time and accidentally meets her ~~deceased~~ mother.
2. Captain America picking up the Mjolnir :hammer: in the final battle against Thanos and his army. 
3. When Falcon calls Captain America and says "On your left", which signals the arrival of all of the superheroes that came back from being dust.
4. Iron Man's inevitable sacrifice that allowed them to win.
